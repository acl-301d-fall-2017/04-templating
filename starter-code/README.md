# Kilovolt Blog!

**Authors**: Jacob Perez
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
A blog featuring posts from multiple authors. Content is decided by authors.

## Getting Started
Build an html page with your desired content incorporating appropriate IDs and classes to be referenced in the stylesheet.

## Architecture
Project was built on html5. It featured css styling and a font library called IcoMoon which provided icons. CSS organized using principles of SMACCS and built with responsive web design in mind. Media queries were used to make the layout appropriate for various screen sizes and chrome dev tools allowed us to test the app on mobile device screens.
